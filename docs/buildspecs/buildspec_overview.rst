.. _buildspec_overview:

Buildspecs Overview
========================

buildspec is your test recipe that buildtest processes to generate a test script.
A buildspec can be composed of several test sections. The buildspec file is
validated with the :ref:`global_schema` and each test section is validated with
a sub-schema defined by the ``type`` field.

Let's start off with a simple example declaring variables::

    version: "1.0"
    buildspecs:
      variables:
        type: script
        executor: local.bash
        vars:
          X: 1
          Y: 2
        run: echo "$X+$Y=" $(($X+$Y))

buildtest will validate the entire file with ``global.schema.json``, the schema
requires **version** and **buildspec** in order to validate file. The **buildspec**
is where you define each test. In this example their is one test called **variables**.
The test requires a **type** field which is the sub-schema used to validate the
test section. In this example ``type: script`` informs buildtest to use the :ref:`script_schema`
when validating test section.

Each subschema has a list of field attributes that are supported, for example the
fields: **type**, **executor**, **vars** and **run** are all valid fields supported
by the *script* schema. The **version** field informs which version of subschema to use.
Currently all sub-schemas are at version ``1.0`` where buildtest will validate
with a schema ``script-v1.0.schema.json``. In future, we can support multiple versions
of subschema for backwards compatibility.


Shown below is schema definition for script-v1.0.schema.json ::

    {
      "$id": "script-v1.0.schema.json",
      "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
      "title": "script schema version 1.0",
      "description": "The script schema is of ``type: script`` in sub-schema which is used for running shell scripts",
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["type", "run", "executor"],
      "additionalProperties": false,
      ...
    }

The ``"type": "object"`` means sub-schema is a JSON `object <http://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/object.html>`_
where we define a list of key/value pair. The sub-schemas are of type ``object``
and have a list of required fields that must be provided when using the schema.
The ``"required"`` field specifies a list of fields that must be specified in
order to validate the Buildspec. In this example, ``type``, ``run``, and ``executor``
are required fields. The ``additionalProperties: false`` informs schema to reject
any extra properties not defined in the schema. In our previous example, the JSON
object is ``variables``.

The **executor** key is required for all sub-schemas which instructs buildtest
which executor to use when running the test. The executors are defined in
:ref:`configuring_buildtest`. In this example we define variables using the
``vars`` property which is a Key/Value pair for variable assignment.
The **run** section is required for script schema which defines the content of
the test script.

Let's look at a more interesting example, shown below is a multi line run
example using the `script` schema with test name called
**systemd_default_target**, shown below is the content of test::

    version: "1.0"
    buildspecs:
      systemd_default_target:
        executor: local.bash
        type: script
        tags: [system]
        description: check if default target is multi-user.target
        run: |
          if [ "multi-user.target" == `systemctl get-default` ]; then
            echo "multi-user is the default target";
            exit 0
          fi
          echo "multi-user is not the default target";
          exit 1

The test name **systemd_default_target** defined in **buildspec** section is
validated with the following pattern ``"^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$"``. This test
will use the executor **local.bash** which means it will use the Local Executor
with an executor name `bash` defined in the buildtest settings. The default
buildtest settings will provide a bash executor as follows::

    executors:
      local:
        bash:
          description: submit jobs on local machine using bash shell
          shell: bash

The ``shell: bash`` indicates this executor will use `bash` to run the test scripts.
To reference this executor use the format ``<type>.<name>`` in this case **local.bash**
refers to bash executor.

The ``description`` field is an optional key that can be used to provide a brief
summary of the test. In this example we can a full multi-line run section, this
is achieved in YAML using ``run: |`` followed by content of run section tab indented
2 spaces.

In this example we introduce a new field ``status`` that is used for controlling how
buildtest will mark test state. By default, a returncode of **0** is **PASS** and
non-zero is a **FAIL**. Currently buildtest reports only two states: ``PASS``, ``FAIL``.
In this example, buildtest will match the actual returncode with one defined
in key ``returncode`` in the status section.



.. _script_schema:

Script Schema
---------------

The script schema is used for writing simple scripts (bash, sh, python) in Buildspec.
To use this schema you must set ``type: script``. The ``run`` field is responsible
for writing the content of test.

For more details on script schema see schema docs at https://buildtesters.github.io/buildtest/


Return Code Matching
---------------------

buildtest can report PASS/FAIL based on returncode, by default a 0 exit code is PASS
and everything else is FAIL. The returncode can be a list of exit codes to match.
In this example we have four tests called ``exit1_fail``, ``exit1_pass``,
``returncode_list_mismatch`` and ``returncode_int_match``.  We expect **exit1_fail** and
**returncode_mismatch** to FAIL while **exit1_pass** and **returncode_int_match**
will PASS.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/pass_returncode.yml

To demonstrate we will build this test and pay close attention to the **status**
column in output.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/pass_returncode.txt


The ``returncode`` field can be an integer or list of integers but it may not accept
duplicate values. If you specify a list of exit codes, buildtest will check actual returncode
with list of expected returncodes specified by `returncode` field.

Shown below are examples of invalid returncodes::

  # empty list is not allowed
  returncode: []

  # floating point is not accepted in list
  returncode: [1, 1.5]

  # floating point not accepted
  returncode: 1.5

  # duplicates are not allowed
  returncode: [1, 2, 5, 5]


Classifying tests with tags
----------------------------

The ``tags`` field can be used to classify tests which can be used to organize tests
or if you want to :ref:`build_by_tags` (``buildtest build --tags <TAGNAME>``).
Tags can be defined as a string or list of strings. In this example, the test
``string_tag`` defines a tag name **network** while test ``list_of_strings_tags``
define a list of tags named ``network`` and ``ping``.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/tags_example.yml

Each item in tags must be a string and no duplicates are allowed, for example in
this test, we define a duplicate tag **network** which is not allowed.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/invalid_tags.yml

If we run this test and inspect the logs we will see an error message in schema validation::

    2020-09-29 10:56:43,175 [parser.py:179 - _validate() ] - [INFO] Validating test - 'duplicate_string_tags' with schemafile: script-v1.0.schema.json
    2020-09-29 10:56:43,175 [buildspec.py:397 - parse_buildspecs() ] - [ERROR] ['network', 'network'] is not valid under any of the given schemas

    Failed validating 'oneOf' in schema['properties']['tags']:
        {'oneOf': [{'type': 'string'},
                   {'$ref': '#/definitions/list_of_strings'}]}

    On instance['tags']:
        ['network', 'network']

If tags is a list, it must contain one item, therefore an empty list (i.e ``tags: []``)
is invalid.

Setting environment variables
------------------------------

You can define environment variables using the ``env`` property, this is compatible
with shells: ``bash``, ``sh``, ``zsh``, ``csh`` and ``tcsh``. It does not work with
``shell: python``. In example below we declare three tests using environment
variable with default shell (bash), csh, and tcsh

.. program-output:: cat tutorials/environment.yml

Environment variables are defined using ``export`` in bash, sh, zsh while csh and
tcsh use ``setenv``. Shown below is a generated test script for csh test::

    #!/bin/csh
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.csh/before_script.sh
    setenv SHELL_NAME csh
    echo "This is running $SHELL_NAME"
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.csh/after_script.sh

Variable Declaration
----------------------

Variables can be defined using ``vars`` property, this is compatible with all shells
except for ``python``. The variables are defined slightly different in csh,tcsh as pose
to bash, sh, and zsh. In example below we define tests with bash and csh.

In YAML strings can be specified with or without quotes however in bash, variables
need to be enclosed in quotes ``"`` if you are defining a multi word string (``name="First Last"``).

If you need define a literal string it is recommended
to use the literal block ``|`` that is a special character in YAML.
If you want to specify ``"`` or ``'`` in string you can use the escape character
``\`` followed by any of the special character. In example below we define
several variables such as `X`, `Y` that contain numbers, variable `literalstring`
is a literal string processed by YAML. The variable `singlequote` and `doublequote`
defines a variable with the special character ``'`` and ``"``. The variables
`current_user` and `files_homedir` store result of a shell command. This can
be done using ``var=$(<command>)`` or ``var=`<command>``` where ``<command>`` is
a Linux command.

.. Note:: You can use the escape character ``\`` to set special character, for instance you can declare a variable in string with quotes by using ``\"``.


.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/vars.yml

Next we build this test by running ``buildtest build -b tutorials/vars.yml``.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/vars.txt

If we inspect the output file we see the following result::

    1+2= 3
    this is a literal string ':' \t \n
    'singlequote'
    "doublequote"
    "This is a multi string"

Shown below is the generated testscript::


    #!/bin/bash
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.bash/before_script.sh
    X=1
    Y=2
    literalstring="this is a literal string ':' \t \n"

    singlequote="'singlequote'"

    doublequote="\"doublequote\""

    multistring="\"This is a multi string\""

    current_user=$(whoami)
    files_homedir=`find $HOME -type f -maxdepth 1`
    echo "$X+$Y=" $(($X+$Y))
    echo $literalstring
    echo $singlequote
    echo $doublequote
    echo $multistring
    echo $current_user
    echo $files_homedir
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.bash/after_script.sh

Customize Shell
-----------------

buildtest will default to ``bash`` shell when running test, but we can configure shell
option using the ``shell`` field. The shell field is defined in schema as follows::

    "shell": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Specify a shell launcher to use when running jobs. This sets the shebang line in your test script. The ``shell`` key can be used with ``run`` section to describe content of script and how its executed",
          "pattern": "^(/bin/bash|/bin/sh|/bin/csh|/bin/tcsh|/bin/zsh|bash|sh|csh|tcsh|zsh|python).*"
        },

The shell pattern is a regular expression where one can specify a shell name along
with shell options. The shell will configure the `Shebang Line <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_
in the test-script. In this example, we illustrate a few tests using different shell
field.

.. program-output:: cat tutorials/shell_examples.yml

The generated test-script for buildspec **_bin_sh_shell** will specify shebang
**/bin/sh** because we specified ``shell: /bin/sh``::

    #!/bin/sh
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.sh/before_script.sh
    bzip2 --help
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.sh/after_script.sh

If you don't specify a shell path such as ``shell: sh``, then buildtest will resolve
path by looking in $PATH and build the shebang line.

In test **shell_options** we specify ``shell: "sh -x"``, buildtest will tack on the
shell options into the shebang line. The generated test for this script is the following::

    #!/bin/sh -x
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.sh/before_script.sh
    echo $SHELL
    hostname
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.sh/after_script.sh


If you prefer to use `csh` or `tcsh` for writing scripts just set ``shell: csh`` or
``shell: tcsh``, note you will need to match this with appropriate executor. For now
use ``executor: local.csh`` to run your csh/tcsh scripts. In this example below
we define a script using csh, take note of ``run`` section we can write csh style.

.. program-output:: cat tutorials/csh_shell_examples.yml

Customize Shebang
-----------------

You may customize the shebang line in testscript using ``shebang`` field. This
takes precedence over the ``shell`` property which automatically detects the shebang
based on shell path.

In next example we have two tests **bash_login_shebang** and **bash_nonlogin_shebang**
which tests if shell is Login or Non-Login. The ``#!/bin/bash -l`` indicates we
want to run in login shell and expects an output of ``Login Shell`` while
test **bash_nonlogin_shebang** should run in default behavior which is non-login
shell and expects output ``Not Login Shell``. We match this with regular expression
with stdout stream.

.. program-output:: cat tutorials/shebang.yml

Now let's run this test as we see the following.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/getting_started/shebang.txt

If we look at the generated test for **bash_login_shebang** we see the shebang line
is passed into the script::

    #!/bin/bash -l
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.bash/before_script.sh
    shopt -q login_shell && echo 'Login Shell' || echo 'Not Login Shell'
    source /Users/siddiq90/Documents/buildtest/var/executors/local.bash/after_script.sh

Python Shell
---------------

You can use *script* schema to write python scripts using the run section. This
can be achieved if you use the ``local.python`` executor assuming you have this
defined in your buildtest configuration.

Here is a python example calculating area of circle

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/python-shell.yml


The ``shell: python`` will let us write python script in the ``run`` section.
The ``tags`` field can be used to classify test, the field expects an array of
string items.

.. note::
    Python scripts are very picky when it comes to formatting, in the ``run`` section
    if you are defining multiline python script you must remember to use 2 space indent
    to register multiline string. buildtest will extract the content from run section
    and inject in your test script. To ensure proper formatting for a more complex python
    script you may be better off writing a python script in separate file and call it
    in ``run`` section.

Skipping test
-------------

By default, buildtest will run all tests defined in ``buildspecs`` section, if you
want to skip a test use the ``skip:`` field which expects a boolean value. Shown
below is an example test.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/skip_tests.yml

The first test **skip** will be ignored by buildtest because ``skip: true`` is defined
while **unskipped** will be processed as usual.

.. Note:: Omitting line ``skip: No`` from test **unskipped** will result in same behavior

.. Note::

    YAML and JSON have different representation for boolean. For json schema
    valid values are ``true`` and ``false`` see https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/boolean.html
    however YAML has many more representation for boolean see https://yaml.org/type/bool.html. You
    may use any of the YAML boolean, however it's best to stick with json schema values
    ``true`` and ``false``.


Here is an example build, notice message ``[skip] test is skipped`` during the build
stage

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/skip_tests.txt

run_only
---------

The ``run_only`` property is used for running test given a specific condition has met.
For example, you may want a test to run only if its particular system (Linux, Darwin),
operating system, scheduler, etc...

run_only -  user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

buildtest will skip test if any of the conditions are not met. Let's take an example
in this buildspec we define a test name **run_only_as_root** that requires **root** user
to run test. The *run_only* is a property of key/value pairs and **user** is one
of the field. buildtest will only build & run test if current user matches ``user`` field.
We detect current user using ``$USER`` and match with input field ``user``.
buildtest will skip test if there is no match.


.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/root_user.yml

Now if we run this test we see buildtest will skip test **run_only_as_root** because
current user is not root.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/root_user.txt

run_only - platform
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similarly, we can run test if it matches target platform. In this example we have
two tests **run_only_platform_darwin** and **run_only_platform_linux** that are
run if target platform is Darwin or Linux. This is configured using ``platform``
field which is a property of ``run_only`` object. buildtest will match
target platform using `platform.system() <https://docs.python.org/3/library/platform.html#platform.system>`_
with field **platform**, if there is no match buildtest will skip test. In this test,
we define a python shell using ``shell: python`` and run ``platform.system()``. We
expect the output of each test to have **Darwin** and **Linux** which we match
with stdout using regular expression.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/run_only_platform.yml

This test was ran on a MacOS (Darwin) so we expect test **run_only_platform_linux**
to be skipped.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/run_only_platform.txt

run_only - scheduler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

buildtest can run test if a particular scheduler is available. In this example,
we introduce a new field ``scheduler`` that is part of ``run_only`` property. This
field expects ``lsf``, ``slurm``, ``cobalt`` as valid values and buildtest will check if target
system supports the scheduler. In this example we require **lsf** scheduler because
this test runs **bmgroup** which is a LSF binary.

.. note:: buildtest assumes scheduler binaries are available in $PATH, if no scheduler is found buildtest sets this to an empty list

.. program-output:: cat ../general_tests/sched/lsf/bmgroups.yml

If we build this test on a target system without LSF notice that buildtest skips
test **show_host_groups**.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/bmgroups.txt


run_only - linux_distro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

buildtest can run test if it matches a Linux distro, this is configured using
``linux_distro`` field that is a list of Linux distros that is returned via
`distro.id() <https://distro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#distro.id>`_. In this example,
we run test only if host distro is ``darwin``.

.. program-output:: cat ../tutorials/run_only_distro.yml

This test will run successfully because this was ran on a Mac OS (darwin) system.

.. program-output:: cat docgen/schemas/run_only_distro.txt
